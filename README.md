# rs-code-visualizer

**rs-code-visualizer** takes all source code / UTF-8 encodable text that you put in the ``./input/`` folder, and renders them to one PNG image. These images show the shape and size of files, but not the exact characters inside the files. If you add non UTF-8 compatible files, they will be skipped from the render. It syntax highlights any type of file it understands.
